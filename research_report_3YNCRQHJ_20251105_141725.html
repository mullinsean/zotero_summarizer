# Analysis: EI Modernization and Impact on Vulnerable Populations

## Summary

This Government of Canada consultation report documents Phase 1 of consultations on modernizing the Employment Insurance (EI) program, conducted from August 2021 to February 2022. The consultations gathered input from over 1,900 survey respondents, 70+ written submissions, and 200+ stakeholders across Canada regarding key issues including access to EI, simplification, life events benefits, self-employment, seasonal work, and the Premium Reduction Program.

The consultations revealed significant concerns about how current EI structures fail vulnerable populations, including part-time workers (predominantly women), seasonal workers, self-employed and gig workers, migrant workers, and those facing multiple life events simultaneously. Worker groups consistently emphasized the need for lower eligibility thresholds, removal of discriminatory barriers (such as "quit" and "fire" disqualifications that disproportionately affect women), and more flexible rules to accommodate non-traditional employment patterns. The report documents a clear divide between worker advocates pushing for expanded access and adequacy, and employer groups concerned about premium increases and labor supply impacts.

The consultation findings highlight that EI's current structure creates particular hardships for vulnerable populations who contribute to the program but face systemic barriers to accessing benefits—including those working multiple part-time jobs, workers experiencing harassment or discrimination who must quit, adoptive parents, self-employed workers, and seasonal workers in regions with limited off-season employment opportunities.

## Relevance Explanation

This source is highly relevant to understanding how EI policy changes could impact vulnerable populations because it systematically documents the concerns, experiences, and recommendations of diverse stakeholders specifically regarding accessibility barriers that disproportionately affect marginalized workers. The consultation explicitly addresses how current EI rules create inequitable outcomes for part-time workers (predominantly women), workers in precarious employment, seasonal workers, self-employed individuals, migrant workers, and those facing intersecting vulnerabilities. The document provides concrete evidence of how policy mechanisms—such as hours-based eligibility thresholds, regional variations, job separation rules, and the treatment of multiple jobs—create differential impacts on vulnerable groups, making it essential for analyzing the equity implications of social safety net reform.

## Key Passages & Quotes

### 1. **Gender and Employment Precarity in Access Rules**

> "Workers and stakeholders representing workers emphasized the need to... improve access for those who contribute but may be excluded through reduced criteria and more flexible qualifying rules... Worker groups also recommended: lowering the hours threshold and/or instituting a hybrid model where the number of weeks might qualify someone in order to better capture part-time and precariously employed workers, who are predominantly women"

**Context & Significance**: This passage explicitly identifies that hours-based eligibility thresholds disproportionately exclude women workers who are overrepresented in part-time and precarious employment. This structural barrier means women contribute to EI but cannot access benefits at the same rate as full-time workers.

**Location**: "What we heard – key takeaways" section, under "Access to EI"

---

### 2. **Discrimination and the "Quit" Disqualification**

> "Labour stakeholders recommended easing or removing the 'quit' and 'fire' disqualifications or to limit these disqualifications to a period of time (for example, 3 weeks). They noted that these disqualifications are more likely to impact women and vulnerable workers in part-time, multiple jobs. They are more likely to leave a job because of harassment, discrimination or other justified reasons that may not be recorded by employers."

**Context & Significance**: This reveals how EI rules penalize workers who leave employment due to workplace harassment or discrimination—situations that disproportionately affect women and vulnerable workers—creating a double victimization where those fleeing toxic workplaces are then denied income support.

**Location**: "Simplifying EI" section

---

### 3. **Self-Employment and COVID-19 Gap**

> "Of the gaps in the EI program highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, none was more evident than the circumstances facing Canada's self-employed and gig workers. Throughout the consultations, there was recognition that many self-employed and contract workers lack access to financial supports in times of hardship and would benefit from an income support program. 85% of survey respondents (and 94% of self-employed respondents) believe that before the introduction of temporary COVID measures, there were not enough financial supports available for the self-employed during periods of hardship"

**Context & Significance**: This demonstrates massive consensus that self-employed and gig workers—who increasingly include workers in precarious, low-income situations rather than high-earning professionals—face a critical gap in social protection, with the pandemic making this vulnerability starkly visible.

**Location**: "Self-employment and gig work" section

---

### 4. **Misclassification as a Systemic Vulnerability**

> "Many worker groups recommended that as a priority, the government should review whether some workers are being misclassified as independent contractors. This would prevent them from accessing the same benefits as employees."

**Context & Significance**: Misclassification represents a structural mechanism through which employers can avoid providing EI coverage to vulnerable workers, effectively excluding them from the social safety net despite performing work similar to employees. This particularly affects immigrant workers, racialized workers, and those with limited bargaining power.

**Location**: "Self-employment and gig work" section

---

### 5. **Migrant Workers' Systemic Exclusion**

> "Worker groups said that migrant workers pay into the program but rarely take advantage of it. They recommended providing them greater access to the program."

**Context & Significance**: Though brief, this passage reveals that migrant workers face a particularly unjust situation where they contribute financially to EI through payroll deductions but face barriers (likely including precarious status, fear of deportation, language barriers, and lack of information) that prevent them from accessing benefits they have paid for. This represents a systemic transfer of resources away from one of Canada's most vulnerable worker populations.

**Location**: "Other issues raised in consultations" section, under "Migrant workers"

---

### 6. **Adequacy Crisis for Low-Income Workers**

> "The current replacement rate for part-time and low income workers was seen as being too low for beneficiaries to be able to cover basic living expenses... 'When I was doing a full-time job with minimum wage, I was getting $2000 per month. But when I apply for EI, I receive 55% of my salary which is $1100 only. How can I survive on 55% of my income?'"

**Context & Significance**: This demonstrates how the 55% replacement rate creates particular hardship for low-wage workers who already live paycheck to paycheck, with EI benefits falling below subsistence levels. This makes EI inadequate precisely for those most economically vulnerable and with no financial cushion.

**Location**: "Adequacy of benefits" section

# Research Analysis: EI Reform and Vulnerable Populations

## 1. Summary

This C.D. Howe Institute report examines fundamental flaws in Canada's Employment Insurance system that have made it slow to respond to economic downturns and inequitable in its treatment of workers across different regions and circumstances. The authors identify critical failures during three major economic crises—the 2008/09 Great Recession, the 2014/15 oil price collapse, and the COVID-19 pandemic—where EI proved unable to meet workers' needs in a timely manner. Particularly problematic was the system's failure to respond to sudden regional unemployment spikes, such as in Alberta during the commodities shock, and its inability to adapt quickly to low-unemployment regions at the pandemic's onset.

The report argues that EI has drifted from its core purpose of providing insurance against unpredictable job losses and has instead become oriented toward indemnifying chronic unemployment. This misalignment has created inequities in access and benefit duration that disproportionately affect certain workers and regions. The authors propose three major reforms: implementing uniform or more universal entrance requirements, sharply reducing the number of EI regions, and improving the responsiveness of benefit duration formulas to labor market changes. These recommendations aim to make EI more equitable across regions and worker types while enhancing its effectiveness as a counter-cyclical economic stabilizer.

The study emphasizes that the current regional variation in entrance requirements and benefit durations creates a two-tiered system where similarly situated unemployed workers receive vastly different treatment based on geography rather than actual need. This structural inequity undermines both the insurance principle and the program's ability to serve as an effective automatic stabilizer during economic shocks.

## 2. Relevance Explanation

This source is highly relevant to research on how EI changes could impact vulnerable populations because it directly addresses the equity failures in the current system that disproportionately affect workers in precarious situations. The document identifies specific vulnerable groups—workers in regions with sudden unemployment spikes, those in low-unemployment areas during economic shocks, and individuals facing unpredictable job losses—who are systematically disadvantaged by current EI structures. The proposed reforms (universal entrance requirements, reduced regional distinctions, improved responsiveness) would fundamentally alter how vulnerable populations access benefits during crises. Understanding these equity gaps and proposed solutions is essential for analyzing how EI reform would affect Canada's most economically vulnerable workers and for informing broader social safety net policy discussions.

## 3. Key Passages & Quotes

### Quote 1: Timeliness Failures During Crises
**Passage:** "During the Great Recession of 2008/09, the oil price collapse in 2014/15, and the most recent pandemic, however, the program has proven itself unable to meet in timely fashion the needs of many workers who face job losses."

**Significance:** This quote establishes a pattern of systemic failure affecting vulnerable populations during their most critical moments of need. Workers who lose jobs during economic crises are among the most vulnerable, and the EI system's inability to respond quickly compounds their economic insecurity. This demonstrates how the current structure fails vulnerable populations precisely when safety net support is most essential.

**Location:** Opening section/main findings

---

### Quote 2: Regional Inequity in Crisis Response
**Passage:** "During the commodities shock, unemployment rates in some regions in Alberta rose sharply, but there was no immediate increase in either benefit duration or ease of access. A similar pitfall emerged in low-unemployment regions at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic."

**Significance:** This passage highlights how the current EI structure creates geographic inequities that leave vulnerable populations without support during localized economic shocks. Workers in Alberta facing sudden job losses and those in traditionally low-unemployment regions hit by the pandemic represent vulnerable populations failed by the system's lack of responsiveness. The regional variation means that identical workers facing identical circumstances receive different treatment based solely on location, creating arbitrary vulnerability.

**Location:** Main body, discussion of program failures

---

### Quote 3: Misalignment with Insurance Principles
**Passage:** "It has also gone off track from its original main goal: to provide insurance against unpredictable job losses."

**Significance:** This fundamental critique reveals how EI has shifted away from protecting workers facing unexpected unemployment—a key vulnerable population. By moving toward "indemnifying chronic unemployment" instead, the system may be failing those who experience sudden, unpredictable job losses (such as due to industry disruptions, company closures, or economic shocks) while potentially over-serving other groups. This misalignment suggests vulnerable populations facing acute, unpredictable crises may be systematically underserved.

**Location:** Opening section

---

### Quote 4: Orientation Away from Shock Protection
**Passage:** "Benefit entitlements should be less oriented to indemnifying chronic unemployment and more responsive to covering unemployment caused by cycles or totally unanticipated shocks like the pandemic."

**Significance:** This policy recommendation directly addresses vulnerable populations who face cyclical or shock-driven unemployment—arguably the most economically precarious workers who have the least ability to prepare for job loss. The current system's failure to prioritize these workers means those affected by pandemics, recessions, or sudden industry collapses (who are most vulnerable and least at fault) receive inadequate support. Reorienting EI toward these populations would fundamentally shift who benefits most from the safety net.

**Location:** Policy recommendations section

---

### Quote 5: Equity Through Uniform Access
**Passage:** "The authors make three main policy recommendations: (i) Implement uniform or more universal entrance requirements. (ii) Sharply reduce the number of EI regions. (iii) Improve the responsiveness of the benefit duration formula to labour market downturns and recoveries."

**Significance:** These recommendations would directly impact vulnerable populations by reducing arbitrary regional barriers to access. Universal entrance requirements would eliminate situations where vulnerable workers in certain regions face higher barriers to benefits than similarly situated workers elsewhere. Reduced regional distinctions and improved responsiveness would ensure that vulnerable populations in all locations receive timely support during economic downturns, addressing the current system's failure to protect workers equitably regardless of geography.

# Research Brief Analysis: EI Changes and Vulnerable Populations

## 1. Summary

This IRPP Working Group Report examines the modernization of Canada's Employment Insurance system, with significant attention to how current gaps and proposed changes affect vulnerable populations. The report reveals that EI coverage has declined dramatically from 80% of unemployed workers (1976-1990) to roughly 40% (2011-2019), largely due to restrictive eligibility criteria introduced in the 1990s. This decline disproportionately affects vulnerable groups including self-employed workers, part-time workers, low-income earners, seasonal workers, and those in precarious employment arrangements.

The working group identified several key problems affecting vulnerable populations: complex eligibility rules that disadvantage workers in low-unemployment urban areas; the 600-hour requirement for special benefits that excludes low-income parents; systemic exclusion of self-employed and gig workers; and insufficient benefit levels (55% replacement rate) that don't allow low- to middle-income individuals to make ends meet. The report proposes reforms including uniform entrance requirements, increased benefit generosity, improved access to special benefits, and addressing the exclusion of self-employed workers. These changes would particularly benefit vulnerable populations who currently fall through the cracks of the system.

## 2. Relevance Explanation

This source is highly relevant to the research brief's focus on how EI changes impact vulnerable populations within the context of social safety net reform. The report explicitly addresses coverage gaps for multiple vulnerable groups (low-income workers, part-time workers, self-employed, seasonal workers, recent parents with low incomes) and documents how past policy changes have systematically excluded these populations. The working group's reform proposals are specifically designed to address inequities affecting vulnerable workers, making this source essential for understanding both current problems and potential solutions for protecting vulnerable populations through EI modernization.

## 3. Key Passages & Quotes

### Quote 1: Decline in Coverage for Vulnerable Workers
**Passage:** "The percentage of unemployed Canadians who received EI benefits fell from about 80 percent on average between 1976 and 1990 to below 50 percent between 2000 and 2010, and to roughly 40 percent between 2011 to 2019... Most of the drop during the 1990s can be attributed to the changes in program eligibility criteria that restricted access to benefits to those with a valid job separation. However, 40 percent of the decline was due to an increase in the share of unemployed individuals who had not contributed to EI in the previous 12 months, because they were either long-term unemployed or self-employed, had dropped out of the labour force, or had only recently entered the labour force."

**Significance:** This demonstrates how policy changes have systematically excluded vulnerable populations, with coverage dropping by half. The causes—stricter eligibility and exclusion of self-employed/long-term unemployed—directly affect the most vulnerable workers.

**Location:** Page 8, Section 2 (Overview of the Employment Insurance Program), Figure 2

---

### Quote 2: Income-Based Disparities in Special Benefits Access
**Passage:** "Take-up of special benefits rises with income. For example, more than 80 percent of recent parents who earn more than $60,000 per year qualified for maternity and parental benefits in 2019, compared with 50 percent of those who earned less than $20,000... 'We have this under-coverage problem in special benefits, and [the benefits] really seem to reward those who actually have more resources,' [Jennifer Robson] said."

**Significance:** This reveals a critical inequity where the most vulnerable workers—those earning under $20,000—have only 50% access to maternity/parental benefits compared to 80% for higher earners. The system paradoxically excludes those who need support most.

**Location:** Page 17, Section 5 (Special Benefits), Figure 3

---

### Quote 3: Variable Entrance Requirements Disadvantage Urban Vulnerable Workers
**Passage:** "Armine Yalnizyan... argued that variable entrance requirements disadvantage low-paid, part-time and on-demand workers living in larger cities, where unemployment rates are relatively low. These rules also affect workers in particular sectors such as food service, accommodation, hospitality and retail industries."

**Significance:** This identifies how current eligibility rules create geographic inequities that specifically harm vulnerable workers in service sectors and urban areas, who need more hours worked to qualify despite having precarious employment.

**Location:** Page 12, Section 4.1 (Eligibility)

### Quote 4: Inadequate Benefit Levels for Low-Income Workers
**Passage:** "Several participants... expressed the view that the current earnings replacement rate of 55 percent is inadequate and does not allow low- to middle-income individuals to make ends meet... Some also recommended that the minimum benefit of $300 a week introduced during the pandemic be made permanent to better support low-income workers. Before the pandemic, there was no minimum floor for EI benefits."

**Significance:** This highlights how current benefit levels fail to meet basic needs for vulnerable low- and middle-income workers, and proposes a concrete solution (permanent $300 minimum) to protect the most vulnerable.

**Location:** Page 14, Section 4.2 (Benefit generosity and earnings replacement rates)

### Quote 5: Exclusion of Self-Employed and Gig Workers
**Passage:** "Of Canada's total unemployed population in 2019, roughly 2.9 million people, or 15 percent of the labour force, identified as self-employed... Although self-employed workers can voluntarily opt in to EI special benefit programs, they currently cannot access regular benefits in case of a layoff because they do not pay premiums... Take-up for the program is low; as of February 2021, only 25,000 workers (less than 0.1 percent of eligible workers) had opted in to the program."

**Significance:** This documents the massive exclusion of self-employed workers (2.9 million people), many of whom are in precarious gig economy jobs. The virtually nonexistent opt-in rate (0.1%) demonstrates that voluntary programs fail to protect vulnerable self-employed workers.

# Research Brief Analysis: EI Changes and Vulnerable Populations

## 1. Summary

This document is a "What We Heard" report from Phase 2 of Canada's Employment Insurance (EI) modernization consultations (April-July 2022). The consultations engaged over 100 stakeholders through roundtables, technical workshops, and written submissions to gather input on EI benefit adequacy, program financing, and supports for self-employed and seasonal workers.

The report reveals significant tension between worker groups and employers regarding EI reforms. Worker groups consistently emphasized that current EI benefits are inadequate, particularly for low- and middle-income workers, with the 55% replacement rate at a "historical low." They advocated for increasing the replacement rate to 66.67-75%, establishing a benefit floor of $300-$500 weekly (matching pandemic levels), and extending benefit duration to 50 weeks maximum. Vulnerable populations highlighted include lower-income workers, seasonal workers facing income gaps, self-employed/gig workers with limited access to benefits, families with children (particularly regarding the outdated family supplement), and workers in precarious employment situations.

Employer groups cautioned against reforms that would increase costs or create disincentives to return to work, especially during pandemic recovery and current labour shortages. The report identifies areas where vulnerable populations face specific challenges: inadequate weekly benefit amounts that don't meet basic needs, difficulties accumulating enough hours to qualify (particularly for seasonal and self-employed workers), income gaps between seasonal work periods, and systemic barriers related to work classification and program accessibility.

## 2. Relevance Explanation

This source is highly relevant to understanding how EI changes impact vulnerable populations because it systematically documents stakeholder perspectives on benefit adequacy and access barriers. The report explicitly addresses concerns about lower-income workers, identifies specific vulnerable groups (seasonal workers, self-employed, families), and provides concrete data on proposed reforms and their potential impacts. It offers insights into how different stakeholder groups view the adequacy of current support levels and reveals the trade-offs between improving benefits for vulnerable populations and concerns about labor market incentives and program costs. The document is particularly valuable because it captures the voices of advocacy organizations, workers' groups, and community organizations representing vulnerable populations directly.

## 3. Key Passages & Quotes

### Quote 1: Inadequacy of Current Benefits for Vulnerable Workers
**Passage:**
> "The current benefit rate of 55% of weekly insurable earnings has many consequences for claimants and their families. The inadequacy of the rate causes a decline in the living conditions of workers who become unemployed. (...) Thus, a state of involuntary unemployment can be catastrophic for a household." (translation) - Written submission from organization

**Significance:** This quote directly addresses how inadequate EI benefits impact vulnerable households, emphasizing that the current system can lead to catastrophic outcomes for families experiencing unemployment. It establishes the baseline concern that current benefits don't adequately protect vulnerable populations.

### Quote 2: Specific Concerns About Low-Income Workers
**Passage:**
> "Worker groups continued to express the need to prioritize increasing access to EI and noted that benefits are currently not adequate for meeting the needs of recipients, in particular for lower income workers."

**Significance:** This identifies low-income workers as a specifically vulnerable population within the EI system, highlighting that inadequacy disproportionately affects this group. It shows that stakeholders recognize differential impacts across income levels.

**Location:** Section "Executive summary"

---

### Quote 3: Proposal for Minimum Benefit Floor
**Passage:**
> "They also suggested that there should be a guaranteed minimum benefit amount (or benefit floor) for anyone who qualifies for EI of around $300 to $500 a week. This benefit floor would match the minimum amount in EI benefits that the government provided during the pandemic on a temporary basis. Labour and community groups suggested that the creation of a permanent EI benefit amount would better enable lower-paid workers to subsist on the weekly amount."

**Significance:** This passage identifies a concrete reform proposal specifically designed to protect vulnerable low-wage workers by ensuring a minimum subsistence level. The reference to pandemic-era measures acknowledges that temporary higher benefits demonstrated feasibility.

**Location:** Section "What we heard – key takeaways" > "Adequacy of EI benefits" > "How much support EI should provide"

### Quote 4: Family Supplement and Gender Equity Concerns
**Passage:**
> "Some participants noted that the supplement is based on household rather than individual income, which disadvantages low income individuals, and in particular women."

**Significance:** This highlights how current EI structures can disadvantage specific vulnerable populations (women and low-income individuals) through program design choices, revealing intersectional vulnerabilities within the system.

**Location:** Section "What we heard – key takeaways" > "Adequacy of EI benefits" > "How much support EI should provide"

### Quote 5: Seasonal Workers and Income Gaps
**Passage:**
> "For others, the weeks of EI that they are entitled to may not be sufficient to bridge the period between the seasonal lay-off and their return to seasonal work. In this case, if the claimant is unable to find other work in the off-season, they experience an income gap."

**Significance:** This identifies seasonal workers as a vulnerable population facing specific structural challenges within the EI system—income gaps that leave them without support during off-seasons. This is particularly relevant as seasonal work is often concentrated in lower-income sectors and rural areas.

**Location:** Section "What we heard – key takeaways" > "Seasonal work"

### Quote 6: Self-Employed and Gig Workers' Vulnerabilities
**Passage:**
> "Many self-employed artists and cultural workers spoke to: unpaid preparation work between contracts, the low wages in the sector, challenges of income volatility, having limited control over hours of work, and gaps in income between contracts with fixed start and end dates"

**Significance:** This passage details the multiple, compounding vulnerabilities faced by self-employed workers in precarious sectors, showing how current EI structures fail to address the realities of modern vulnerable work arrangements.

##To Do

Summarizer:
[] update prompt to optimize summaries (use Open Deep research?)
[] add tagging feature --> extract tags from annotated outline and apply them to documents as they are summarized
[] add tagging feature --> add tags back into Zotero?
[] access website directly if HTML snapshot doesn't exist  (add back into Zotero?)
[] iterate over subcollections as well?
[] add ability to handle OCR pdfs

Question Answerer:
[] pose a query that can be answered a) by just going through paper summaries b) by going through all source documents in a collection c) "smart method" where LLM decides whether to review entire source document based how relevant the summary is to the question
[] version where instead of answer question, it uses the above method to return most relevant sources

Zotero Collections:
[] collection processing --> make sure all attachments have parent nodes;

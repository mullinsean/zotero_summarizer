<h1>Research Brief Response: EI Changes and Vulnerable Populations</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This "What We Heard" consultation report documents Phase 1 findings from the Government of Canada's Employment Insurance modernization initiative (August 2021 - February 2022). The consultations engaged over 1,900 survey respondents, 70+ written submissions, and 200+ stakeholders across roundtables to gather input on EI program reform. Key themes include access barriers, program simplification, self-employment and gig work coverage, seasonal worker support, parental benefits flexibility, and program sustainability. The report identifies significant gaps in current EI coverage for non-traditional workers and emphasizes that vulnerable populations—including part-time workers, women, racialized groups, and precarious workers—face disproportionate barriers to accessing benefits despite contributing to the program.</p>
<p>The consultation reveals strong consensus that EI has not kept pace with modern labor market realities. Worker advocates prioritized expanding access through reduced eligibility criteria and more flexible qualifying rules, while employer groups emphasized financial sustainability and labor market responsiveness. Notably, the report documents specific vulnerabilities: women in part-time and multiple-job arrangements face barriers from "quit" and "fire" disqualifications; self-employed workers (85% of survey respondents) reported insufficient financial supports; seasonal workers experience fluctuating regional unemployment rates that affect their benefits; and parents face inflexible rules when combining life events with employment changes.</p>
<h2>Relevance Explanation</h2>
<p>This source is directly relevant to the social safety net reform brief because it comprehensively documents how proposed EI modernization could impact vulnerable populations. The report explicitly identifies disparities affecting women, part-time workers, seasonal workers, self-employed and gig workers, racialized communities, 2SLGBTQQIA+ families (particularly adoptive parents), persons with disabilities, and precarious workers. The consultation findings provide empirical evidence of current EI exclusions and the stated needs of vulnerable populations, making it essential for analyzing how EI reform could either mitigate or exacerbate social safety net gaps. The report's candid discussion of trade-offs between program access and financial sustainability directly informs broader social policy questions about balancing equity and fiscal responsibility.</p>
<h2>Key Passages &amp; Quotes</h2>
<h3>1. <strong>Differential Impact on Vulnerable Workers</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Labour stakeholders recommended easing or removing the 'quit' and 'fire' disqualifications or to limit these disqualifications to a period of time (for example, 3 weeks). They noted that these disqualifications are more likely to impact women and vulnerable workers in part-time, multiple jobs. They are more likely to leave a job because of harassment, discrimination or other justified reasons that may not be recorded by employers."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong> Directly identifies how current EI rules disproportionately harm women and vulnerable workers. This passage explicitly connects structural barriers (disqualifications for job separation) to demographic vulnerability, demonstrating that EI reform must address not just access but the gendered and racialized dimensions of employment precarity.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> "Simplifying EI" section</p>
<hr />
<h3>2. <strong>Self-Employment Gap and Vulnerable Populations</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"85% of survey respondents (and 94% of self-employed respondents) believe that before the introduction of temporary COVID measures, there were not enough financial supports available for the self-employed during periods of hardship."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong> Quantifies a critical safety net gap for self-employed workers—a population increasingly including vulnerable groups with limited alternative income security. The high response rate indicates broad consensus on this systemic failure, making it essential to EI modernization discussions.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> "Self-employment and gig work" section, Figure 5</p>
<hr />
<h3>3. <strong>Barriers for Part-Time and Precarious Workers</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Workers and stakeholders representing workers emphasized the need to... improve access for those who contribute but may be excluded through reduced criteria and more flexible qualifying rules... lowering the hours threshold and/or instituting a hybrid model where the number of weeks might qualify someone in order to better capture part-time and precariously employed workers, who are predominantly women."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong> Identifies that part-time and precariously employed workers—disproportionately women—contribute to EI but remain excluded by current hour-based eligibility requirements. This demonstrates a fundamental social safety net gap affecting vulnerable populations.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> "Access to EI" section</p>
<hr />
<h3>4. <strong>Low-Income Worker Inadequacy</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"When I was doing a full-time job with minimum wage, I was getting $2000 per month. But when I apply for EI, I receive 55% of my salary which is $1100 only. How can I survive on 55% of my income?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong> Illustrates how the current replacement rate (55%) renders EI insufficient for low-income workers to meet basic living expenses—a critical adequacy issue disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations. This quote encapsulates the inadequacy of benefits for those with lowest income security.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> "Adequacy of benefits" subsection, "Other issues raised in consultations" section</p>
<hr />
<h3>5. <strong>Intersectional Vulnerability in Adoptive Families</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"The faces of children and youth being adopted have changed dramatically - kids are typically older, have sibling groups and have special needs. We are asking for a more equitable and inclusive system at 15 weeks of attachment leave, which is the same as for parents who gave birth."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong> Demonstrates how EI rules create differential treatment for vulnerable populations (adoptive families, including LGBTQ2+ families and those with special needs children) and documents advocacy by these groups for equitable access. Shows how EI modernization intersects with multiple social policy areas.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> "Life events" section</p>
<hr />
<h2>Additional Context: Survey Demographics Reflecting Vulnerable Populations</h2>
<p>The survey respondents included representation from multiple vulnerable groups documented in Annex C:<br />
- <strong>20%</strong> identified as members of racialized groups<br />
- <strong>18%</strong> identified as members of 2SLBGTQQIA communities<br />
- <strong>16%</strong> identified as Indigenous<br />
- <strong>34%</strong> represented seasonal workers<br />
- <strong>67%</strong> were female respondents (compared to 33% male)</p>
<p>This demographic composition confirms that the consultation explicitly engaged vulnerable populations and captured their distinct experiences with EI barriers.</p>

<h1>Research Brief Analysis: EI Reform and Vulnerable Populations</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The C.D. Howe Institute's report argues that Canada's Employment Insurance program requires significant modernization to function effectively as both an economic stabilizer and equitable social safety net. The source highlights that EI has failed to adequately respond to major economic shocks—including the 2008/09 recession, the 2014/15 oil price collapse, and the COVID-19 pandemic—leaving many vulnerable workers without timely support. The report identifies a critical gap between EI's current design and its foundational purpose: providing insurance against unpredictable job losses.</p>
<p>The authors propose three key reforms: implementing more universal entrance requirements, reducing the number of EI regions, and making benefit duration formulas more responsive to labour market downturns. These recommendations directly address equity concerns, as the current system's regional variation and restrictive access criteria disproportionately affect workers in economically volatile regions and those with non-standard employment patterns. By making EI more responsive and equitable, the reforms aim to strengthen the social safety net for populations most exposed to employment shocks.</p>
<h2>Relevance Explanation</h2>
<p>This source is highly relevant to the research brief on social safety net reform because it directly examines how structural deficiencies in EI disproportionately harm vulnerable populations. The source's emphasis on inequitable access criteria, regional disparities, and inadequate responsiveness to economic shocks provides concrete evidence of how vulnerable workers—including those in oil-dependent regions and those in low-unemployment areas during sudden crises—fall through gaps in the current system. The policy recommendations for more universal entrance requirements and responsive benefit formulas offer concrete pathways to address these equity concerns, making this source essential for understanding both the problem and potential solutions in social safety net design.</p>
<h2>Key Passages &amp; Quotes</h2>
<h3>Quote 1: Core Problem Statement</h3>
<p><strong>"EI has proven itself to be slow to react to downturns, weakening its ability to automatically stabilize the economy. It has also gone off track from its original main goal: to provide insurance against unpredictable job losses."</strong></p>
<p><strong>Context &amp; Significance:</strong> This opening statement establishes the fundamental failure of EI to serve its intended purpose, directly linking program inadequacy to vulnerable populations who experience sudden, unanticipated unemployment. This framing sets the stage for understanding why vulnerable workers lack protection.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Quote 2: Regional Equity Failure</h3>
<p><strong>"During the commodities shock, unemployment rates in some regions in Alberta rose sharply, but there was no immediate increase in either benefit duration or ease of access."</strong></p>
<p><strong>Context &amp; Significance:</strong> This concrete example demonstrates how the current regional EI structure fails vulnerable populations in economically volatile regions. Workers experiencing rapid job losses in commodity-dependent areas receive no enhanced support despite acute need, illustrating geographic inequity in the safety net.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Quote 3: Universal Access Problem</h3>
<p><strong>"A similar pitfall emerged in low-unemployment regions at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic."</strong></p>
<p><strong>Context &amp; Significance:</strong> This observation reveals that vulnerable workers in lower-unemployment regions face barriers to EI access precisely when sudden shocks occur, showing that current eligibility criteria are misaligned with protection during crisis periods. This affects workers who may have limited EI history but face unexpected job loss.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Quote 4: Policy Recommendation on Equity</h3>
<p><strong>"Implement uniform or more universal entrance requirements."</strong></p>
<p><strong>Context &amp; Significance:</strong> This recommendation directly addresses equity gaps by proposing to remove barriers that currently exclude vulnerable workers with non-standard employment histories or those in specific regions. Universal entrance requirements would extend coverage to populations currently underserved by EI.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Quote 5: Benefit Structure Reform</h3>
<p><strong>"Benefit entitlements should be less oriented to indemnifying chronic unemployment and more responsive to covering unemployment caused by cycles or totally unanticipated shocks like the pandemic."</strong></p>
<p><strong>Context &amp; Significance:</strong> This statement reframes EI's purpose toward protecting vulnerable workers facing cyclical and sudden job losses rather than chronic unemployment, directly supporting more equitable coverage for populations affected by economic shocks beyond their control.</p>

<h1>Research Brief Response: EI Changes and Vulnerable Populations</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This IRPP working group report examines the modernization of Canada's Employment Insurance system, addressing long-standing structural gaps that have become increasingly critical as labor market conditions have shifted. The report identifies significant coverage exclusions affecting vulnerable worker populations, particularly self-employed workers, gig workers, part-time workers, and those in precarious employment arrangements. The working group recommends substantial reforms to increase accessibility, generosity, and responsiveness of EI, while acknowledging the complex trade-offs between expanded coverage and the program's financing mechanisms. The analysis includes detailed modeling of how proposed reforms would affect different income groups and premium rates.</p>
<p>The document highlights how current EI eligibility rules disproportionately disadvantage low-income, part-time, and marginalized workers. Special attention is given to how regional variable entrance requirements, the exclusion of self-employed workers, and complex eligibility rules create systematic barriers for vulnerable populations. Additionally, the report demonstrates that special benefits (maternity, parental, sickness, caregiving) show dramatic income-based disparities in take-up rates, with higher-income workers far more likely to access these protections than lower-income workers.</p>
<h2>Relevance Explanation</h2>
<p>This source is highly relevant to the research brief on vulnerable populations and EI reform because it explicitly documents how current EI design systematically excludes or inadequately serves vulnerable groups. The report provides concrete evidence of coverage gaps affecting specific vulnerable populations (low-income workers, part-time employees, self-employed workers, seasonal workers, and those in precarious gig work) and proposes targeted reform options that would disproportionately benefit these groups. For a social safety net reform paper, this source offers both diagnosis of vulnerabilities and policy solutions grounded in expert analysis and empirical data.</p>
<h2>Key Passages &amp; Quotes</h2>
<h3>Passage 1: Systematic Exclusion of Vulnerable Workers</h3>
<p><strong>Quote:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Variable entrance requirements disadvantage low-paid, part-time and on-demand workers living in larger cities, where unemployment rates are relatively low. These rules also affect workers in particular sectors such as food service, accommodation, hospitality and retail industries."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong> This passage directly identifies how current EI eligibility structures create barriers specifically for vulnerable worker populations in precarious employment. It demonstrates that vulnerability extends across multiple dimensions: income level, work type, geography, and sector.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Section 4.1 (Eligibility), page 12</p>
<hr />
<h3>Passage 2: Income Disparities in Special Benefits Access</h3>
<p><strong>Quote:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"More than 80 percent of recent parents who earn more than $60,000 per year qualified for maternity and parental benefits in 2019, compared with 50 percent of those who earned less than $20,000... We have this under-coverage problem in special benefits, and [the benefits] really seem to reward those who actually have more resources."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong> This empirical evidence (Figure 3) demonstrates how vulnerable populations—specifically low-income families—face significant barriers accessing EI special benefits. The 30-percentage-point gap in access between highest and lowest income groups reveals how the current system fails to protect those most in need of income support during critical life events.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Section 5 (Special Benefits), page 17</p>
<hr />
<h3>Passage 3: Self-Employed and Gig Worker Exclusion</h3>
<p><strong>Quote:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The growing number of individuals who work for digital platforms and are classified as self-employed poses a particular challenge... In 2019, roughly 2.9 million people, or 15 percent of the labour force, identified as self-employed... Although self-employed workers can voluntarily opt in to EI special benefit programs, they currently cannot access regular benefits in case of a layoff because they do not pay premiums."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong> This passage identifies a major vulnerability affecting over 2.9 million Canadian workers who are systematically excluded from EI regular benefits due to their employment classification. This represents a fundamental gap in social protection for a growing segment of vulnerable workers, particularly those in platform-based gig work who lack traditional employment protections.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Section 4.1.1 (Self-Employed Workers), page 13</p>
<hr />
<h3>Passage 4: Coverage Crisis for Unemployed Workers</h3>
<p><strong>Quote:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Over 35 percent of unemployed workers before the pandemic comprised [self-employed workers and those without insurable earnings in the previous 12 months]... The percentage of unemployed Canadians who received EI benefits fell from about 80 percent on average between 1976 and 1990 to below 50 percent between 2000 and 2010, and to roughly 40 percent between 2011 to 2019."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong> These statistics demonstrate the scale of vulnerability in Canada's social safety net. The dramatic decline in EI coverage over three decades reveals systemic exclusion of vulnerable populations, with over one-third of unemployed workers—presumably those in more precarious situations—entirely outside the system before the pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Section 2 (Overview), pages 8-9</p>
<hr />
<h3>Passage 5: Complexity Barriers for Vulnerable Claimants</h3>
<p><strong>Quote:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"According to Robson, there are more than 200 rules that stipulate how various EI regular and special benefits can be combined, most of which apply to combinations of special benefits... accessing some special benefits imposes administrative hurdles on claimants at a time when they are least able to cope with them, as they are dealing with illness or caring for a critically ill family member."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong> This passage reveals how system complexity creates additional barriers for vulnerable claimants who are already experiencing hardship. The administrative burden of navigating 200+ benefit combination rules particularly disadvantages those with lower education levels, less access to professional assistance, and those managing health crises or caregiving responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Section 5 (Special Benefits), page 18</p>
<hr />
<h2>Additional Relevant Finding</h2>
<p>The report documents how pandemic temporary measures (CERB, CRB) revealed systemic failures in regular EI to protect vulnerable workers: "According to Employment and Social Development Canada, of the gaps in the EI system highlighted by the pandemic, 'none was more evident than the circumstances facing Canada's self-employed and gig workers'" (Box 1, page 10). This indicates that the pandemic exposed pre-existing vulnerabilities that require structural reform rather than temporary measures.</p>

<h1>Research Brief Analysis: EI Changes and Vulnerable Populations</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This Phase 2 consultation report on modernizing Canada's Employment Insurance program documents stakeholder feedback on proposed EI reforms, with significant implications for vulnerable populations. The report highlights that <strong>worker groups consistently prioritized the need to increase EI access and adequacy, particularly emphasizing that current benefits are insufficient for lower-income workers</strong>. Key concerns raised include the current 55% replacement rate being at a historical low, inadequate maximum insurable earnings caps, and insufficient benefit duration. The document reveals divergent positions between labour groups (advocating for higher replacement rates of 66.67-75%, higher maximum insurable earnings, and longer benefit periods) and employer groups (cautioning against increased financial burdens and concerns about work disincentives). Special attention is given to vulnerable worker populations, including seasonal workers, self-employed and gig workers, and low-income families with children.</p>
<p>The report documents consultation feedback on multiple vulnerable populations affected by EI: seasonal workers who face income gaps during off-seasons, self-employed and gig workers lacking adequate income support mechanisms, and lower-income families who struggle on current benefit levels. Stakeholders explicitly identified that the current family supplement—a targeted support for low-income EI claimants with children—is inadequate and outdated. The consultations reveal structural barriers for vulnerable groups, including challenges in meeting eligibility requirements, insufficient benefit amounts to cover basic living expenses, and gaps between benefit periods and actual need periods.</p>
<h2>Relevance Explanation</h2>
<p>This source is directly relevant to the research brief as it provides detailed documentation of how proposed EI modernization changes would impact vulnerable populations. The report explicitly addresses the adequacy crisis for lower-income workers, documents concerns about seasonal workers facing income gaps, discusses barriers for self-employed workers (often precarious workers), and examines the insufficiency of supports for families with children. For a paper on social safety net reform, this source reveals critical gaps in how EI currently protects vulnerable populations and documents stakeholder recommendations for reform that would specifically improve outcomes for lower-income, seasonal, self-employed, and family-dependent workers. The consultation feedback demonstrates that EI modernization decisions carry direct consequences for economic security of Canada's most vulnerable workers.</p>
<h2>Key Passages &amp; Quotes</h2>
<h3>Passage 1: Lower-Income Worker Inadequacy</h3>
<p><strong>Quote:</strong> "Worker groups continued to express the need to prioritize increasing access to EI and noted that benefits are currently not adequate for meeting the needs of recipients, <strong>in particular for lower income workers</strong>."</p>
<p><strong>Context &amp; Significance:</strong> This foundational statement from the executive summary establishes that inadequacy of current EI benefits disproportionately affects lower-income workers. This is one of the most consistent themes across both Phase 1 and Phase 2 consultations, indicating systemic vulnerability for this population. This directly supports a social safety net reform paper by demonstrating a clear gap in current EI protections.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Executive Summary, opening paragraph</p>
<hr />
<h3>Passage 2: Replacement Rate Insufficient for Basic Needs</h3>
<p><strong>Quote:</strong> "Many participants voiced concerns that EI benefits are inadequate. They expressed that the current replacement rate is at a historical low and provides insufficient weekly benefit amounts for low- and middle-income unemployed individuals. Labour groups and some academics commonly suggested to increase the replacement rate to 66.67% or 75% for all claimants."</p>
<p><strong>Context &amp; Significance:</strong> This documents that the current 55% replacement rate fails to meet basic income needs for vulnerable populations. The gap between current rates (55%) and recommended rates (66.67-75%) represents a quantifiable adequacy gap. This is particularly relevant for vulnerable populations who have minimal savings to bridge income shortfalls.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> "Adequacy of EI benefits" section, "How much support EI should provide" subsection</p>
<hr />
<h3>Passage 3: Family Supplement Inadequacy and Structural Barriers</h3>
<p><strong>Quote:</strong> "Some labour and community groups suggested...that there should be a guaranteed minimum benefit amount (or benefit floor) for anyone who qualifies for EI of around $300 to $500 a week...Labour and community groups suggested that the creation of a permanent EI benefit amount would better enable lower-paid workers to subsist on the weekly amount...Some participants also suggested changes to the family supplement...they suggested the government increase and expand the supplement, which has not been indexed over time...Some participants noted that the supplement is based on household rather than individual income, which disadvantages low income individuals, and in particular women."</p>
<p><strong>Context &amp; Significance:</strong> This passage identifies multiple structural vulnerabilities affecting low-income families, particularly women. It documents that the family supplement—specifically designed for vulnerable populations—has not been updated in years and contains design flaws (household vs. individual income basis) that disadvantage vulnerable groups. This reveals how current EI reform gaps specifically harm families with children and women.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> "Adequacy of EI benefits" section, "How much support EI should provide" subsection</p>
<hr />
<h3>Passage 4: Seasonal Workers Face Income Gaps</h3>
<p><strong>Quote:</strong> "For many of these workers, EI benefits are an important source of income in the off-season when work in seasonal industries is not available. However, some workers in seasonal industries face challenges...the weeks of EI that they are entitled to may not be sufficient to bridge the period between the seasonal lay-off and their return to seasonal work. In this case, if the claimant is unable to find other work in the off-season, <strong>they experience an income gap</strong>."</p>
<p><strong>Context &amp; Significance:</strong> This passage documents a concrete vulnerability for seasonal workers—a precarious population—who face recurring income gaps despite EI access. It establishes that current benefit duration is inadequate for this vulnerable group's actual employment cycles. Seasonal workers are disproportionately represented in lower-wage sectors and face systemic income insecurity.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> "Seasonal work" section</p>
<hr />
<h3>Passage 5: Self-Employed and Gig Workers Excluded from Protections</h3>
<p><strong>Quote:</strong> "Similar to input received during Phase 1, we heard that workers who are classified as self-employed are a diverse group with divergent income support needs...Participants were generally more supportive of increasing access and flexibility for workers with some self-employment rather than establishing a new standalone benefit. In particular, they supported enhancing flexibilities for workers in 'mixed employment'...do not accumulate enough hours to qualify for EI, or if they do qualify for EI when they experience an involuntary interruption of work, they may not be able to pursue self-employment activities and keep their EI benefits."</p>
<p><strong>Context &amp; Significance:</strong> This documents a major vulnerability gap: self-employed and gig workers lack adequate EI protection, either through exclusion from accumulating qualifying hours or through rules that prevent them from maintaining income sources while on claim. This is particularly relevant to modern precarious work arrangements and reveals how current EI design fails to protect growing segments of the vulnerable workforce.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> "Self-employment and gig work" section</p>
<hr />
<h3>Passage 6: Explicit Statement on Inadequacy for Lower-Income Workers</h3>
<p><strong>Quote:</strong> "The current benefit rate of 55% of weekly insurable earnings has many consequences for claimants and their families. The inadequacy of the rate causes a decline in the living conditions of workers who become unemployed. (...) Thus, a state of involuntary unemployment can be catastrophic for a household." [translation from written submission]</p>
<p><strong>Context &amp; Significance:</strong> This submission from an organization directly articulates how current EI inadequacy creates cascading hardship for vulnerable households, framing EI insufficiency not as an abstract policy issue but as a driver of household poverty and economic catastrophe. This provides powerful evidence for a social safety net reform paper.</p>

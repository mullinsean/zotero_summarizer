Research Topic: Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Software Development Practices

I am researching how artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies are transforming software development practices. Specifically, I am interested in:

1. AI-assisted code generation and completion tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT for coding)
2. Automated testing and bug detection using AI
3. Impact on developer productivity and code quality
4. Ethical considerations and potential risks
5. How AI is changing the role of software developers

I am looking for:
- Empirical studies measuring productivity impacts
- Case studies from companies implementing AI tools
- Analysis of code quality metrics before/after AI adoption
- Developer perspectives and surveys
- Discussion of limitations and challenges
- Future predictions and trends

Please focus on peer-reviewed research, industry reports, and authoritative technical analyses published in the last 3-5 years.

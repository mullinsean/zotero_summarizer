Research Project: Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Software Development Practices

This research project examines how artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies are fundamentally transforming software development practices in the modern tech industry. The study aims to produce a comprehensive technical report for software engineering managers and technical leaders who are evaluating the adoption of AI-assisted development tools.

Key Research Areas:
1. AI-assisted code generation and completion tools (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude Code, etc.)
2. Automated testing, bug detection, and code review using machine learning
3. Quantitative impacts on developer productivity and velocity
4. Code quality metrics and technical debt implications
5. Ethical considerations, bias, and security concerns
6. Changes to developer roles, skills, and workflows
7. Organizational adoption patterns and best practices

The research will synthesize findings from peer-reviewed academic studies, industry reports, case studies from major tech companies, and surveys of developer experiences. The goal is to provide evidence-based recommendations for organizations considering AI tool adoption, including implementation strategies, potential ROI, and risk mitigation approaches.

Target deliverable: A 20-30 page technical report with executive summary, methodology, findings, case studies, and actionable recommendations.

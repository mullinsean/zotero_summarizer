SOVEREIGNTY, NOT SOLITUDE: A SOVEREIGN AI STRATEGY FOR CANADA

CORE THESIS

Canada must pursue a pragmatic, risk-based approach to digital sovereignty centered on being "free from coercion" rather than pursuing technological self-sufficiency or digital isolationism. The goal is strategic autonomy - ensuring Canadian data and digital infrastructure are governed by Canadian laws and values, secure from foreign threats, and resilient to geopolitical pressures, while remaining competitive in the global digital ecosystem.

KEY DRIVERS

Geopolitical: Rising great-power competition, supply chain vulnerabilities (especially semiconductors), cybersecurity threats, and risks from foreign laws like the U.S. CLOUD Act

Economic: Closing Canada's AI adoption gap is critical for productivity gains, wage growth, and maintaining competitiveness. LLMs represent a transformational inflection point for knowledge work that Canada must capitalize on.

FRAMEWORK

The paper proposes a two-dimensional model:

Dimension 1 - Seven-Layer Technology Stack:
1. Physical Infrastructure (power, data centers, secure facilities)
2. Compute Hardware (GPUs, CPUs, accelerators, interconnects)
3. Cloud and Network Infrastructure (IaaS/PaaS, storage, data transit)
4. Orchestration and MLOps (training/inference tooling, schedulers)
5. Foundation Models (training, fine-tuning)
6. Applications (APIs, enterprise integrations)
7. Data and Data Governance

Dimension 2 - Three-Tier Security Classification:
- Tier 1 (Absolute Sovereignty): National security, defense, intelligence - requires fully air-gapped, Canadian-owned infrastructure
- Tier 2 (Jurisdictional Sovereignty): Healthcare, finance, critical public services - requires Canadian data storage under Canadian law exclusively
- Tier 3 (Strategic Resilience): General business and consumer applications - allows global hyperscalers with strong contractual controls, data residency, and encryption

STRATEGIC PRIORITIES

- Distinguish between compute needs for AI training (massive upfront costs) versus inference (distributed, ongoing deployment)
- Emphasize securing inference capacity first to accelerate adoption and productivity
- Use open-source software and models strategically to prevent vendor lock-in
- Leverage government procurement and "lighthouse projects" to catalyze adoption
- Prepare for 2026 CUSMA renegotiations with clear positions on data localization and digital trade
- Build alliances with other middle powers on AI standards and compute pooling

APPROACH

The paper will conduct a layer-by-layer assessment of Canada's current position across the technology stack, creating a "Canada Exposure Heatmap" that visualizes dependencies and vulnerabilities. It will provide a sequenced roadmap across three time horizons (0-12 months, 1-3 years, 3-7 years) with specific policy recommendations and investment priorities emphasizing public-private collaboration.

The research includes outreach to business leaders, tech sector, telecommunications, hyperscalers, and experts in national security, public policy, and legal domains.

CORE MESSAGE

True digital sovereignty is not about building a fortress but about securing critical perimeters so Canada can confidently engage with the world on its own terms, ensuring its digital future is guided by Canadian values through strategic autonomy rather than autarky.
